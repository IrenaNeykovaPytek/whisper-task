# Voice Textify Web Application: Bringing Your Words to Life

Voice Textify is a modern web application designed to enhance user engagement by combining **voice input** and **typewriter-style text animations**. It allows users to speak and have their words transformed into text that animates dynamically, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Voice-to-Text Conversion**:

- Uses the openai/whisper API to convert spoken words into text seamlessly.

- Supports multiple languages based on browser compatibility.

- **Typewriter Text Animation**:

- Displays the transcribed text with a typewriter-style animation.
- **Interactive User Interface**:

- Simple and intuitive design for users to start and stop voice input.

## How It Works

1.  **Start Voice Input**:

- Click the "Record voice" button to begin voice recoding.
- Click the "Stop recording" when you are done recording.
- You can optionally preview the recorded audio using the media player.
- Click the "Start Listening" button to begin voice recognition.
- Click the "Convert to text" button to transcribe your recorded voice to text.

2.  **Typewriter Animation**:

3.  **Stop or Reset**:

- You can click the "Clear recording" button to clear your current recording and transcription.
